What are Data Structures?
--A data structure is a way to store data.
--We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.

What are Algorithms?
--An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.

Data Structures together with Algorithms
--Data structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand. A data structure is not worth much if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using algorithms, and the algorithms in this tutorial are not worth much without a data structure to work on.
